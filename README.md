# Advice for children's screen and social media use

On 7 February 2019, the Department of Health and Social Care posted a document
to their website, in which the UK Chief Medical Officers’ (CMO) gives commentary
on "Screen-based activities and children and young people’s mental health and
psychosocial wellbeing: a systematic map of reviews".<sup>[1]</sup>

Page 11 of that document gives some tips for balancing screen use with healthy living.
